However, the operator of the service is not obliged to do so.\nWe have no influence over linking pornographic, political, potentially dangerous (e.g. computer viruses).\nAny linked content is in no way representative of the public opinion of the developer or operator of the service.",
  "datenschutz_dialog": "The twa.si URL shortener offers a free service for shortening links that can be used without registration.\nFor this purpose, a small amount of data is collected and stored permanently.\nThe following explains what is saved, when to save data, and why the data needs to be saved.\n\nIf you create a short link using the URL shortener, the following data is saved:\n\n\tâ€¢ Exact time of creation\n\tâ€¢ The URL to redirect to\n\tâ€¢The selected <tag> of the URL (twa.si/r/tag) if set\n\tâ€¢ The IP address from which the link was created.\n\nThe URL as well as the <Tag> are saved for the functionality of the shortener, since no forwarding can take place without saving.\nThe user's IP address and the time of creation serve statistical and moderation purposes on the one hand.\nTo avoid abuse we save the IP address\nIn addition, the system prevents a too large number of short links created in a short time based on the IP address.\n\nApart from the IP address, no data is collected that could establish a connection between the user who created a short link and the short link itself."
